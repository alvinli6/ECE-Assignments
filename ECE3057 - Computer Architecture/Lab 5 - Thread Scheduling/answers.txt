Problem 1B
----------

1 CPU: 67.6 s
2 CPUs: 36.5 s
4 CPUs: 35.0-s

Total execution time decreases with more CPUs, but the relationship between CPU and time is inversely exponential. This is why 1 CPU's difference with 2 CPUs is so much different from 2 to 4's.


Problem 2B
----------

800ms: 136 CS, 67.7 s TET, 329.8 s in READY
600ms: 159 CS, 67.6 s TET, 312.7 s in READY
400ms: 201 CS, 67.7 s TET, 301.6 s in READY
200ms: 360 CS, 67.9 s TET, 292.7 s in READY

This is not always the best choice in a real OS because it takes time to pause a process and push it back onto a ready queue. If a process takes a long time, then this will result in a larger penalty over time. 


Problem 3B
----------

1) It is not realistic to attemp implementing a longest time remaining algorithm because there is no way of accurately predicting how long a process has left before it terminates.

2) R: 285.7 s in READY state
   L: 390.6 s in READY state

   Round robin is lower because of the preempting processes based on time_slice.
