# ECE-Assignments
C/C++ and SystemVerilog Labs from my undergraduate time at Georgia Tech

ECE2035 is a computer organization course that included assignments in MIPS Assembly and C. Since most of the initial assignments were trivial, I only included the final project, 
which was a role-playing game in C. The game was implemented on a breadboard using the mBed microcontroller and various components (LCD screen for game display, buttons, accelerometer, etc.).
The game is played as a quest where the player tilts the breadboard to move around and complete tasks.

ECE2036 is an object-oriented C++ course where labs 4 and 6 were also completed using the mBed microcontroller. Lab 4 is a "Lemur Training System" that randomly generated a shape
of two different sizes on both halves of an LCD screen. The player's (Lemur's) objective is to select the side with the larger object. Lab 6 is a "Galaga" type game where the user
controls a ship by tilting the breadboard and shoots incoming aliens with buttons.

ECE3057 is a computer architecture course that covers processor design, memory systems, threading, and on-chip power/energy consumption. The single-cycle and pipelined processors
were done in Verilog/SystemVerilog, while cache, virtual memory, and thread scheduling labs were done in C/C++.

ECE4100/6100 is an advanced/high-performance computer architecture course. The labs cover superscalar processors, out-or-order processors, and a multicore hierarchical cache system all
in C/C++.

ECE6115 is an advanced graduate course on interconnection networks (NoC). The labs use gem5 Garnet2.0 to explore different interconnection topologies, deadlock avoidance, and flow
control. The code is composed of Python and C/C++.
